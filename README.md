# xppToolbox

A small collection of tools used for
1. converting XPP ode files to other formats
2. plotting XPP bifurcation diagrams
3. writing changes back to XPP ode files

### 1. converting XPP ode files
A parser for XPP files, and code generation tools to create:
* Matlab m-file or mex-file versions of the ODE system
* OpenCL version that runs with clODE (link to repo)
* XML file compatible with [VFGEN](http://www.warrenweckesser.net/vfgen/)
* VCML file compatible with the ODE mode of [Virtual Cell](http://vcell.org/)

### 2. plotting XPP bifurcation diagrams and nullclines
Inspired by PlotXppaut by Mohammad S. Imtiaz

### 3. writing changes back to XPP
Based on XPP-Matlab by Rob Clewley
